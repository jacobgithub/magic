Excellent! Magic: the Gathering is probably the coolest game in the world!

I love this, because I always try and make new decks, but I need to remember what cards I've taken out of my deck and what cards I've put in!

If only I had two lists where I could do that.  OH WAIT! I do now!  Awesome!

What else can Magic: the list do?
-All sorts of stuff hahaha!
